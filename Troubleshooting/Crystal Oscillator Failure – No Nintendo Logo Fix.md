## üõ†Ô∏è EZ-Flash Omega ‚Äî Crystal Oscillator Replacement Guide

üìé Related discussion: [Issue #3 ‚Äì Crystal Oscillator Failure (No Nintendo Logo)](https://github.com/ChimeraGaming/GBA-EZ-Flash-2025-Guide/issues/3)

If your EZ-Flash Omega boots **without showing the Nintendo logo**, and you've already:

- Cleaned the cartridge pins  
- Reformatted the SD card to FAT32 (64K allocation)  
- Reloaded the kernel (`ezkernel.bin`)  
- Held `R` during boot to force a kernel reflash  
- Tested in another GBA/SP device  

Then the issue may be a **faulty crystal oscillator**.

### ‚úÖ Identifying the Faulty Component

The oscillator is a small silver 4-pin SMD part, labeled `24.545`, located just below the yellow RTC battery.

### üß∞ Replacement Tips

1. Use hot air or a fine-tip iron to desolder the old oscillator  
2. Clean the pads with flux and solder wick  
3. Align and reflow the new 3225 oscillator carefully  
4. Once installed:
   - Insert your microSD card with a fresh `ezkernel.bin`
   - Hold `R` on boot to reload the kernel
   - Test the cart in a known working GBA/SP

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Only replace this part if you're confident with SMD soldering or have access to proper tools.
- Ensure the frequency is **exactly 24.545 MHz** ‚Äî other values will cause the cart to fail detection.
