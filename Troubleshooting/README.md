# EZ-Flash Omega (DE) Troubleshooting Guide

This section covers common issues with the EZ-Flash Omega Definitive Edition and how to resolve them. Whether you’re facing ROM detection problems, save corruption, boot loops, or cheat malfunctions, this guide can help.

---

## ROM Doesn’t Show Up

**Causes:**
- Unsupported file type (only `.gba`, `.gb`, `.gbc`, `.nes` supported)
- ROM buried too deep in folder hierarchy
- Special characters in the file name
- Corrupt or incompatible ROM

**Solutions:**
- Store ROMs in `/GBA/`, `/GB/`, `/NES/`, etc.
- Keep folder names short and simple
- Rename ROMs to remove non-alphanumeric characters
- Use clean, verified ROMs only

---

## Save File Not Working or Keeps Resetting

**Causes:**
- Powering off without returning to the kernel menu
- Save type mismatch
- 128KB dual-save games (e.g., Pokémon) not properly handled

**Solutions:**
- Save in-game twice, then return to the EZ-Flash menu
- Confirm a `.sav` is created in `/SAVER/`
- Refer to the [Save Behavior Guide](../Docs/Save.md)

---

## Pokémon “Save is Corrupted” Message

**Why it happens:**  
Pokémon titles use 128KB Flash saves with dual slots. If one slot isn’t updated, the game flags the save as corrupt.

**Solutions:**
- Save twice in-game
- Return to the kernel before shutting off
- If needed, delete the `.sav` and restart from a clean state

---

## Game Boots Then Instantly Reboots

**Causes:**
- Bad patch
- Incompatible ROM
- Incorrect save type

**Solutions:**
- Use [GBATA](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/601/) to clean headers
- Verify ROM integrity before patching
- Reapply patch to a verified ROM

## Game Loads to White Screen

**Causes:**
- ROM hack built on FireRed v1.1 (use v1.0 instead)
- Corrupt `.sav` or `.cht` file
- SD card format issues
- Incompatible cheats
- Broken theme or outdated kernel

**Solutions:**
- Use FireRed v1.0 for patches
- Delete `.sav` and `.cht` files
- Format SD to FAT32 with 64KB allocation
- Disable cheats and test again
- Update to latest kernel
- Patch ROM using [NUPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/606/)

## Controls Lag or Menu Glitches

**Causes:**

**Solutions:**
