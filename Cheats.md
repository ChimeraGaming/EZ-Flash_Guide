🧠 Updated Cheat Database

Looking for a more complete or updated cheat library?

Check out this community effort to **convert the Libretro cheat database for EZ-Flash**:  
🔗 [GBAtemp Thread – Convert the Libretro Database Cheats to EZ-Flash](https://gbatemp.net/threads/convert-the-libretro-database-cheats-to-ezflash.652742/)

📝 This project offers a much more extensive `.cht` library than the default one included with most firmware setups. It's a great resource if you're having trouble finding cheats for less common titles or newer ROM hacks.

Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the thread for how to:
- Merge converted `.cht` files
- Organize them into your `CHEAT/` folder
- Test them on your Omega or Omega DE
