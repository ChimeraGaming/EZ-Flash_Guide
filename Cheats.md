Looking for a more complete or updated cheat library?

Check out these community effort to **convert the Libretro cheat database for EZ-Flash**:  
🔗 [GBAtemp Thread – Convert the Libretro Database Cheats to EZ-Flash](https://gbatemp.net/threads/convert-the-libretro-database-cheats-to-ezflash.652742/) 
- The .rar file found here does have more Cheats than EZ-Flash Official

🔗[Jer-IRL Github - Py 1-Line Convert Libretro Datbase Cheats to EZ-Flash](https://github.com/jer-irl/update_ezflash_cheats)
- Amazing way to update all your cheats with 1 Command
- Needs: "Nintendo - Game Boy Advance (20250602-123637).dat" & [Libretro-database-master](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database) for the most up to date cheats.

📝 This project offers a much more extensive `.cht` library than the default one included with most firmware setups. It's a great resource if you're having trouble finding cheats for less common titles or newer ROM hacks.

Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the thread for how to:
- Merge converted `.cht` files
- Organize them into your `CHEAT/` folder
- Test them on your Omega or Omega DE

Once you confirm that it is indeed RAM WRITE you can then convert it to EZ-Flash Format.

- All my testing so far confirmed same results when it's a RAM Write = Works
