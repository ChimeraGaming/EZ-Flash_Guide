Updated Cheat Database

Looking for a more complete or updated cheat library?

Check out these community efforts to **convert the Libretro cheat database for EZ-Flash**:

- [GBAtemp Thread – Convert the Libretro Database Cheats to EZ-Flash](https://gbatemp.net/threads/convert-the-libretro-database-cheats-to-ezflash.652742/)  
  The `.rar` file found here includes more cheats than the official EZ-Flash database.

- [Jer-IRL GitHub – 1-Line Python Script to Convert Libretro Database to EZ-Flash Format](https://github.com/jer-irl/update_ezflash_cheats)  
  - Easily update all your cheats with one command  
  - Requires:
    - `Nintendo - Game Boy Advance (20250602-123637).dat`
    - [Libretro-database-master](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database) (for the latest cheats)

This project offers a much more extensive `.cht` library than the default one included with most firmware setups. It’s a great option if you're looking for codes for obscure titles or new ROM hacks.

Be sure to follow instructions in the thread for:

- Merging converted `.cht` files
- Organizing your `CHEAT/` folder
- Testing on your Omega or Omega DE

Custom Cheat Code Conversion
---

Use [GameHacking.org GBA Section](https://gamehacking.org/system/gba) to find cheat codes.

Example explanation: https://ibb.co/CqJZDkx  
If a code is labeled **ROM Patch**, it must be converted to a ROM patch (not a cheat code).

For instance, this post shows how someone converted a shiny Pokémon ROM patch for Pokémon Unbound:

Once you've confirmed the code is a **RAM Write**, convert it to EZ-Flash format using:

- [AR2CHT Cheat Converter Tool](https://ar2cht.netlify.app/)

All confirmed RAM Write conversions work properly with the Omega and Omega DE.
