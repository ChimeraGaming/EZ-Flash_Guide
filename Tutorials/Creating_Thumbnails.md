# üñºÔ∏è Creating Thumbnails for Omega DE

This guide walks you through creating and using **game thumbnails** on your EZ-Flash Omega Definitive Edition.

---

## üß† What Are Thumbnails?

Thumbnails are `.bmp` images that appear beside your ROMs in the game browser. They make your flashcart look like a modern game menu.

## üìè Thumbnail Requirements

| Property     | Value                        |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| File Format  | `.bmp` (bitmap)              |
| Dimensions   | **120x80 pixels**            |
| Color Depth  | **24-bit (RGB)**             |
| File Name    | Must match the **4-letter Game ID** (e.g., `BPRE.bmp`) |
| Folder       | Stored inside `/IMGS/` subfolders based on Game ID |

## üÜî Finding or Making a 4-Letter Game ID

The **Game ID** is what the EZ-Flash kernel uses to match thumbnails. For official games, you can extract this code from the ROM header. For ROM hacks, you can **create your own custom ID** using **RHEA**.

### üîç Official ROMs

Use [GBATA](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/601/) or [RHEA](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/542/) to find the **Game Code** (4-letter serial) from your ROM.

Example:
- FireRed v1.0 ‚Üí `BPRE`
- Metroid Fusion ‚Üí `AMTE`

### üõ†Ô∏è ROM Hacks: Custom Game IDs with RHEA

Use [RHEA](https://github.com/sterophonick/rhea) to assign a custom Game Code:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **RHEA Folder Bug Warning**  
> If multiple `.gba` files are in the same folder, RHEA may rename all of them to match the first ROM‚Äôs Game ID.  
> **To avoid this:**
> - Place each `.gba` file in its own folder before opening with RHEA  
>   - Suggested: `/Thumbnails/Needs Formatting/Game Name/GameName.gba`  
> - Change folders **between games** if doing multiple edits  
> - **Close and reopen RHEA after each ROM**  
> - After renaming, move each `.gba` into a clean `/Formatted/` folder to help with next steps.

## üîß Auto Method (Thumbmaker)

1. Open **EZ Omega Thumbmaker**
2. Load an image (cover art or screenshot)
3. It resizes to 120√ó80 BMP automatically
4. Rename the BMP to the Game ID (e.g., `ODYS.bmp`)
5. Place it in the proper `/IMGS/` subfolder (see next section)

---

## üìÅ Final File & Folder Structure

Once your thumbnail is complete:

- ‚úÖ The filename must be `XXXX.bmp` where `XXXX` is the 4-letter Game ID (all caps)
- ‚úÖ It must be placed into a **folder path based on its serial**, like so:

```
/IMGS/B/P/BPRE.bmp    ‚Üê for Game ID BPRE  
/IMGS/O/D/ODYS.bmp    ‚Üê for Game ID ODYS  
/IMGS/U/N/UNBD.bmp    ‚Üê for Game ID UNBD
```

> üìÇ If the folders don't exist, **create them manually**. All folder names and file names must be **UPPERCASE**.

| Game Title           | Game Code | ROM File               | Thumbnail Path         |
