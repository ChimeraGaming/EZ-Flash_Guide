# 📝 Editing Save Files

Learn how to safely extract, edit, and reinsert save files (`.sav`) for use with the EZ-Flash Omega Definitive Edition and other GBA/GB carts. Whether you're modifying items, unlocking events, or fixing a corrupted save, this guide walks you through it.

## 📂 Where Save Files Are Stored

On the microSD, look inside the `/SAVER/` folder.  
Each file follows this format:

```
/SAVER/GameName.sav
```

- `.sav` files are typically **64KB or 128KB**
- Pokémon and some larger games use **128KB dual-slot saves**
- Save files are automatically backed up by the kernel after powering off properly

## 🧠 Important Save Workflow

Before removing the SD card from your cart:

1. **Save in-game TWICE**, waiting at least 5 seconds between saves (especially in Pokémon and large games).
2. **Return to the kernel menu** (via in-game addon or soft reset).
3. Wait for the **auto-backup to complete** (you’ll see "Saving... Do not turn off").
4. Power off the device.
5. Only then remove the SD card and insert it into your PC.

Skipping this process can result in a blank or overwritten `.sav` file.

## ❌ PKMDS or PKHeX Save File Errors

You may see this error:

> “The selected save file is invalid. If this save file came from a ROM hack, it is not supported. Otherwise, try saving in-game and re-exporting / re-uploading the save file.”

### 🔧 Fixes:

- **For ROM hacks**: Most editors do not support custom headers or save structures used in hacks. These saves are often incompatible with PKMDS/PKHeX.
- **Try resaving in-game** twice and allow proper export as described above.
- **Convert the save** to match expected format using this online tool:  Keep the name simple (you can rename when saving in PKHex)

## 🧾 How to Edit a Save

1. **Complete the in-game save process** (see above).
2. Insert the SD card into your PC.
3. Navigate to `/SAVER/` and find your `.sav`.
4. **Make a backup copy** — rename it to `Game_backup.sav`.
5. Open the file in a supported save editor (see tools above).
6. Make your changes, then save/overwrite the `.sav` file.
7. Reinsert the SD into your cart and launch the game to verify.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- **Game shows “corrupted save”**: The cart expects valid checksum or dual-slot sync. Use PKHeX or in-game saves to revalidate.
- **Wrong save size**: Some games use 64KB while others (Pokémon, Boktai) require 128KB. If unsure, check with GBATA.
- **Save edits not appearing**: Make sure you replaced the correct `.sav`, followed the full save flow, and used compatible tools. (Could have been overwritten when loading up EZ-Flash if you skipped this step before)

---

## 🧪 Advanced: Extracting Saves from NOR

If the game was flashed to NOR memory, your save might be stuck in internal SRAM.  
To retrieve it:

1. Boot the NOR game, then immediately return to the kernel.
2. The cart will auto-dump the current SRAM save into `/SAVER/`.

---

## 🧤 Safety Tips

- Never remove the SD card while powered on
- Save **twice** and return to menu before powering off
- Always keep a backup of `.sav` before editing
- Test edits in an emulator before using on hardware
- Avoid editing ROM hack saves unless you're familiar with their custom structure
