# ROM Dumping & Patching Guide

Bad ROMs and pre-patched files are the number one cause of crashes, freezes, and save issues on EZ-Flash Omega and Omega DE. This guide ensures you're using clean, compatible ROMs and applying patches properly.

---

## Start with a Clean ROM

A clean ROM is an unmodified game dump that exactly matches the original cartridge.

### Best Practices

- Use No-Intro verified ROMs when possible
- File extensions: `.gba`, `.gb`, `.gbc`, `.nes`
- Avoid downloading "pre-patched" or "ROM hack included" files

> Tip: Use [Hashtab](https://implbits.com/products/hashtab/) to verify your ROM hash matches known good dumps.

## Patching a ROM Hack

Most ROM hacks come as a patch file (.IPS, .UPS, or .BPS) and must be applied to a clean ROM.

### Required Tools

| Patch Type | Tool | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| IPS        | [Lunar IPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/) | Simple tool for `.ips` patches |
| UPS        | [NUPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/606/), [Tsukuyomi](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/519/) | `.ups` patches are common for FireRed hacks |
| BPS        | [Flips](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/) | Used in newer ROM hacks |
| Online     | [ROM Patcher JS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) | Browser-based patcher for all formats |

### How to Patch (Example for NUPS)

1. Open NUPS  
2. Select "Apply an UPS Patch to a File"  
3. Load the clean ROM  
4. Load the `.ups` patch file  
5. Save as a new `.gba` file  

> Always test the patched ROM on a PC emulator (e.g. mGBA or VBA-M) before using on EZ-Flash

## How to Verify a Clean ROM

You can verify a clean ROM by comparing it against a No-Intro database.

- Use [Hashtab](https://implbits.com/products/hashtab/) or [QuickHash](https://sourceforge.net/projects/quickhash/)
- Match the CRC32, SHA1, or MD5 to known dumps from No-Intro  
- FireRed v1.0 CRC32: `84EE4776`

---

## Organizing Patched ROMs

After patching, you can:

- Place `.gba` files in `/GBA/`
- Rename the file for clarity (e.g. `Pokemon Odyssey v4.gba`)  
  (Make it simpler if save issues occur)
- Avoid symbols and long names
- Delete leftover `.ips` or `.ups` files from your microSD

> Do not rename `.sav` or `.cht` files manually — let the kernel handle them or use [Online Converter](https://savefileconverter.com/#/mister)

## Dumping Your Own ROMs (Optional but Recommended)

Want guaranteed clean ROMs for patching or preservation? Dump them yourself using trusted hardware.

### Tools for Dumping GBA/GB/GBC ROMs

| Method | Tool | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Flash Boy Cyclone | Hardware USB dumper | Works for GBA and older GB carts |
| GBxCart RW | Multi-system cart reader | Reliable and open-source |
| Epilogue GB Operator | USB-based GBA reader with native UI | Great for backups, works on Windows/Mac/Linux |
| Retrode 2 | Cartridge reader with plugins | Works for GBA, SNES, and more |

> These tools dump unencrypted ROMs — good for patching. Commercial DS/3DS games are encrypted and require different tools (not supported here).

---

### Best Practices When Dumping

- Use the tool’s raw backup mode (not .sav-only)
- Dump multiple times and compare file hashes
- Use [Hashtab](https://implbits.com/products/hashtab/) to verify consistent CRC32 between dumps
- Rename the file for clarity (e.g. `FireRed_v1.0_clean.gba`)
- Store original dumps separately from patched or modified files

> Bonus: These tools can also extract `.sav` files to be edited or backed up.

---

## Avoid These Mistakes

- Using v1.1 FireRed for v1.0 hacks
- Applying patches to already-patched ROMs
- Using zipped or 7z ROM files (must be extracted)
- Trying to patch inside a mobile file manager app

---

## Final Tips

- Always backup your original ROM before patching
- Test ROMs on emulators before using them on hardware
- Reapply patches if you're unsure — it's safer than guessing
