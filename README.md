CHEAT CODE CONVERSION
---
Go to https://gamehacking.org/system/gba

Example Explanation = https://ibb.co/CqJZDkx 

If you see ROM Patch, It means exactly that, it needs converted to a ROM PATCH 
- Example Image: https://ibb.co/CKRW83mB 
Someone helped me with a ROM PATCH for Shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Unbound
- https://gbatemp.net/threads/ez-flash-omega-ded-i-need-help-with-custom-cheats.671909/#post-10667087

Once you confirm that it is indeed RAM WRITE you can then convert it to EZ-Flash Format.
- You can convert it Here: https://ar2cht.netlify.app/ #
- All my testing so far confirmed same results when it's a RAM Write = Works


> Example Game.cht File

    [Debug]
    ON=B578,7D,03;B57C,F8,00,A8,00
    
    [Extra codes just put a space between the codes like this]
    #Extra ON Code here and these 2 can be repeated hundreds of times in 1 file. (basically how ever many cheats you want)
    
    [GameInfo]
    Name=2377 - Mother 3 (J)
    System=GBA
