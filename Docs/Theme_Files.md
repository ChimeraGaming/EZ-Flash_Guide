## Tools for Editing

- [EZ-Flash Theme Editor](https://www.ezflash.cn/themeEditor/)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or Photoshop for editing BMPs
- [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/) for quick conversion

Save images in **16-bit RGB565** format. Most editors default to 24-bitâ€”these will not work.

## Tips and Best Practices

- Keep image dimensions consistent with the default kernel resolution
- Use contrasting colors between font and background for readability
- Avoid using spaces or special characters in file or folder names
- Test theme visibility with long and short ROM names

## Advanced Customization

- `.skn` files may include layout, transparency, cursor offsets, and more
- Some third-party tools allow unpacking `.skn` files for direct edits
- Themed kernels apply global styles alongside your theme assets
