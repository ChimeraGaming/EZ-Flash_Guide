# Homebrew on EZ-Flash

EZ-Flash cartridges such as the Omega and Omega DE fully support `.gba` homebrew files — including indie games, emulators, and utilities. This page explains how to use them.

## What is Homebrew?

Homebrew refers to unofficial software created by independent developers. For the Game Boy Advance (GBA), this includes:

- Custom games  
- Utility tools (e.g., save managers)  
- Emulators for older systems (NES, GB, etc.)  
- Tech demos and experiments

## How to Use Homebrew on EZ-Flash

1. **Download a `.gba` Homebrew File**  
   Example: [PocketNES](https://github.com/pinobatch/pocketnes)

2. **Copy to microSD**  
   Place the file anywhere on your SD card. Suggested directory:
   ```
   Root/Homebrew/PocketNES.gba
   ```

3. **Insert & Launch**
   - Insert the microSD into your EZ-Flash cartridge
   - Boot your GBA and navigate to the file using the EZ-Flash browser
   - Press `A` to launch the homebrew

4. **Saving (if supported)**
   - Most homebrew doesn't require saving
   - If it does, EZ-Flash will usually auto-create a `.sav` file
   - For apps that don’t support SRAM saving natively, use [GBATA](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/601/) to apply an SRAM patch

## Tips

- Use **clean `.gba` builds** directly from the developer or trusted sites  
- Do not use IPS/UPS patches unless instructed to  
- Most homebrew does not require a specific save type, but if something doesn’t save, try patching it  
- Avoid homebrew meant for other platforms like Atari ST or OpenDingux — they will not run on GBA hardware
