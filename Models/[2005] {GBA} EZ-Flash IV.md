## ⚠️ Limitations

- ⚠️ **Requires patching all ROMs** via EZClient before copying to SD
- ⚠️ **No RTC (Real Time Clock)** – Games like Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire will run but won’t track time-based events properly
- ⚠️ **Save files not automatically written to SD** — must use soft reset or power down to store SRAM to file
- ⚠️ **No NOR flash** — games are loaded into PSRAM every time
- ⚠️ **Limited homebrew compatibility**

## 🧰 Required Tools

- 🔧 **EZClient** (for patching GBA ROMs and applying SRAM fixes)
- 🧪 **Cheat Code tools** (optional, or manual database edit)

Firmware updates are typically installed via `ezfla_up.bin` placed on the root of the microSD card.

Latest firmware and tools may still be found via archive mirrors, GBAtemp threads, or preserved EZFlash.cn links.
