## 🧰 Software Tools

- 🔧 **GBA ExpLoader** (by Rudolph)
  - Used to manage GBA game flashing, rumble control, and RAM activation
- 🔄 **Patch games** with SRAM/EEPROM compatibility if needed

---

## 💾 Save System

- Battery-backed SRAM for save storage
- Save must be manually written back to microSD via software (e.g. ExpLoader)
- Save files stored by Slot-1 cart on SD card, not onboard

---

## 📌 Usage Tips

- Use **PSRAM** for fast loading (up to ~16MB)
- Use **NOR** for larger or persistent GBA games (up to 32MB on 3-in-1 Plus)
- Use **Slot-1 cart + GBA ExpLoader** for best control
- Compatible with emulators (i.e., DS homebrew like SNEmulDS) for RAM features

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ Not compatible with DSi or 3DS (no Slot-2)
- ❌ Battery may degrade over time (saves will be lost if not replaced)
- ❌ No menu/GUI — controlled entirely through Slot-1 tools

---

## 📝 Notes

- Excellent companion to Slot-1 DS flashcarts that lack GBA support
- Still favored by some retro DS users for lightweight setups
