The **EZ-Flash Advance** was released in the early 2000s during the infancy of GBA flashcart development. It relied on onboard NOR memory and required a proprietary linker to transfer ROMs from a PC. These models are no longer manufactured but were widely used before microSD-based solutions took over.
